Dario DDS
=========

This is my entry for Ludum Dare 32 - Theme: Unconventional weapons.

You are Dario, DDS.  Recently out of dental school and very much in debt you
have nefariously decided to ruin everyone's teeth with candies.  Stack up four
of the same color candies in a row or column to clear them and rot the teeth
nearby.  You lose if the mouth gets too full.  You win by clearing out all the
teeth in the mouth.

### Controls ###

    Left/Right/A/D - Move candy
    Up/Q/W/E       - Rotate candy

    Space          - Pause
