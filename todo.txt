 * barf when you lose
 * fix make dependencies
 * random hair
 * falling pieces buggy
 * bug when processing matches
   - if a match's first piece is removed
     by another match the former will be
     disregarded, example:

       o      This vertical match will
       o      not be cleared because
       o      the bottom one is gone
      oooo    after clearing the other

 * process matches after spawning
   candies
 * loss condition fix (rapid piece
   spawning issue)
   - This could be solved easily by
     removing the weird shapes
 * improve tooth graphics
 * increase number of colors with level
   - possibly then remove weird shapes
 * get rid of "magic numbers"
 * braces that block all your shit
 * endless mode with growing teeth
 * toothpastes that move around and
   block things
 * multiplayer / versus
 * Progression
   - patient dialog
   - some kind of story

 * building saliva level that washes
   away candies
 * wiggly roots that bump candy away
 * random tool intervention or powerups
